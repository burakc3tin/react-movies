## React Movies

This is a react project. After typing the name of the cinema in the search field, it brings you information about the movie. It shows you the poster of the movie, the description of the movie, the imdb score, the language of the movie. I used `React` , `Redux` and `Bootstrap` technologies while making the project. I used `TMDB Api` to show movie information. Using this API, I quickly showed the data on the screen.
